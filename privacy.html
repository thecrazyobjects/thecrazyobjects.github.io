        </header>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Santosh Gupta (Proprietorship), doing business as Neelkanth Enterprises ("us", "we", or "our"), operates the Chatsocialai platform (the "Service"). This policy outlines our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

            <div class="alert">
                <strong>A Note on Data Processing (GDPR):</strong> Our Service is a B2B (Business-to-Business) platform. This creates two different roles for data protection:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>We as Data Controller:</strong> We act as a "Data Controller" for the personal information we collect directly from you, our Client (e.g., your business name, email address, and payment information).</li>
                    <li><strong>We as Data Processor:</strong> You (our Client) are the "Data Controller" for your customers' data ("End-User Data"). We act as a "Data Processor" for this End-User Data, meaning we only process it according to your instructions (i.e., to provide the Service).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This policy primarily covers our obligations as a Data Controller for your Client information.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect (as Data Controller)</h2>
            <p>We collect the following information directly from you, our Client:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Business Contact Information:</strong> Your name, legal business name, trade name, email address, phone number, and physical address.</li>
                <li><strong>Billing Information:</strong> Payment details and transaction history required for billing.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information on how you access and use the Service, such as API logs, IP addresses, and service configuration details.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Information We Process (as Data Processor)</h2>
            <p>To provide the Service, we process the following "End-User Data" on your behalf:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Messaging Data:</strong> The content of messages, images, and other media sent by your customers and your AI-powered responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact Identifiers:</strong> Your customers' phone numbers (for WhatsApp) or user IDs (for Instagram).</li>
                <li><strong>CRM Data:</strong> Any data you store or process via our integration with your Google Sheets, such as customer names, order details, etc..</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect or process for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide, maintain, and bill for our Service.</li>
                <li>To notify you about changes to our Service.</li>
                <li>To provide customer support.</li>
                <li>To monitor the usage of our Service to prevent fraud and ensure security.</li>
                <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. How We Share Information (Sub-processors)</h2>
            <p>We do not sell your data. We only share information with third-party service providers ("Sub-processors") who act on our behalf to provide the Service. Our primary sub-processors are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>OpenAI, L.L.C.:</strong> We send End-User Data (like message content) to OpenAI's API to generate AI responses. As per OpenAI's API-use policies, they do not use data submitted via their API to train their models.</li>
                <li><strong>Google LLC:</strong> We process data with the Google Sheets API *only* as directed by you when you configure the integration. We are not responsible for Google's data practices.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Data Security and Retention</h2>
            <p>We use commercially reasonable measures to protect the security of your data. We retain your Client Information as long as your account is active or as needed to comply with our legal obligations. We retain End-User Data processed on your behalf according to the terms of our agreement with you or as you configure in the Service (e.g., conversation history).</p>

            <h2>6. Your Data Rights (CCPA & GDPR)</h2>
            <p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding the personal information we hold about you *as a Data Controller* (i.e., your Client Information).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can request a copy of your Client Information.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Correction:</strong> You can request to correct any inaccurate Client Information.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> You can request to delete your Client Information, subject to our legal obligations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>For Your End-Users:</strong> As you are the Data Controller for your End-User Data, you are responsible for handling their data rights requests. We will assist you as required by law.</p>
            <p><strong>"Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" (CCPA):</strong> We do not "sell" or "share" your personal information or your End-User Data as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). You have the right to opt-out, but as we do not sell data, no action is necessary.</p>
